Task #03: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail.

👉 Problem Statement: Perform Exploratory data analysis on dataset “SampleSuperstore” and try to find out where you can work to make more profit. I have created a dashboard in Power BI and made visuals showing total profit and sales, regions showing the quantity of sales and profits in a geomap, sales by category, segment and ship mode, least and high performing states average of sales by sub-category. It is concluded that central region is the least performing area and West region is highest performing area while Wyoming is the least performing state and New York is the highest performing state. So some subcategories like Copiers and Machines to be introduced for sales in some states to increase revenue.
